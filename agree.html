<pre>    Worldstar Hip Hop Online Video Submission Agreement

    Thank you again for submitting your video to our website for consideration for posting. This
    Agreement will confirm the rights and responsibilities that you and Worldstar Hip Hop have with
    regard to the video.

    By submitting the video, you hereby grant Worldstar Hip Hop and its parent company, Worldstar LLC,
    ("Worldstar") the irrevocable right and license to duplicate, broadcast, exhibit, transmit and
    exploit the video, or to allow Worldstar to grant sublicenses to third parties to duplicate,
    broadcast, exhibit, transmit and exploit the video, on the internet, television, mobile platforms
    or other media throughout the world.

    You agree that Worldstar shall not be required to make any payment to you or anyone else in
    exercise of the rights granted in this Agreement, and acknowledge that you shall receive valuable
    consideration in the form of placement of and promotion of the video.

    You represent that you either created the video yourself or have received the legal right and
    authority from the person who created the video to grant to Worldstar full and unrestricted rights
    to the video, and that our exercise of such rights shall not constitute an infringement of any
    copyright, civil, personal or property right of any third party. If you are submitting a music
    video, you represent that you have full authority, permission and license from all copyright
    holders in the visual and musical works you submit to Worldstar.  Because clearing copyright in
    musical works can be complicated, you should be aware that Worldstar maintains licenses with BMI,
    ASCAP and SESAC in order to ensure that all copyright holders in any musical work get compensated
    properly.

    Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, Worldstar shall have no obligation to publish or post your
    video. For all videos published or posted upon the site, we reserve the right to remove the video
    at our discretion and we will give no refunds or compensation.

    You hereby agree that you will indemnify Worldstar, its officers, employees and agents, from and
    against any and all claims, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses arising from
    any breach or alleged breach of any term, warranty or condition of this agreement, or from any
    claims of infringement or alleged infringement arising from your audio and/or video submission.
